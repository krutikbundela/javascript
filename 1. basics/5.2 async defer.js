 * defer

In HTML and JavaScript, the defer attribute is used with the <script> tag to control when a script file is executed. It allows the browser to download the script in parallel with parsing the HTML but defers the script's execution until after the HTML document has been fully parsed.

Why Use defer?
When including JavaScript files in an HTML document:

Without defer:

Scripts block the HTML parsing process.
The browser stops rendering HTML, downloads the script, and executes it before continuing to parse.
With defer:

The script is downloaded in parallel with HTML parsing.
The script is executed only after the HTML document is fully parsed.
This improves page load performance and ensures scripts don't block the rendering process.

Syntax
html
Copy code
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
How defer Works
Scripts with defer are executed in the order they appear in the document.
They are executed after the HTML parsing is complete, but before the DOMContentLoaded event.
Example Without defer
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Without defer</title>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the browser stops parsing the HTML at <script> to download and execute script.js.
HTML parsing is blocked until the script finishes.
Example With defer
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>With defer</title>
  <script src="script.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
Execution Order:
The browser downloads script.js in parallel while parsing the HTML.
The script is executed after the entire HTML document is parsed.
The DOMContentLoaded event fires after the script execution.
Key Differences Between async and defer
Attribute	Execution Timing	Order of Execution	Blocks HTML Parsing?
async	As soon as the script is downloaded	Unordered	Yes (partially, until done)
defer	After HTML parsing is complete	Ordered (top-to-bottom)	No
async Example:
html
Copy code
<script src="script.js" async></script>
Scripts with async are executed as soon as they're downloaded.
They do not wait for the HTML parsing to complete.
Scripts with async execute in no particular order.
When to Use defer?
When the script depends on the HTML structure.
When you want to load scripts without blocking the HTML parsing process.
When script execution order matters.
Practical Example
HTML:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Defer Example</title>
  <script src="first.js" defer></script>
  <script src="second.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
first.js:
javascript
Copy code
console.log("First script executed");
second.js:
javascript
Copy code
console.log("Second script executed");
Output in Console:
sql
Copy code
First script executed
Second script executed
Both scripts are downloaded in parallel.
They execute in order after the HTML document has been fully parsed.
Summary
*?defer allows scripts to download in parallel while ensuring execution happens after HTML parsing.
*?Scripts with defer execute in the order they appear in the HTML document.
It improves page load performance without blocking the rendering process.

async

In JavaScript, the async attribute is used with the <script> tag to load external scripts asynchronously. Scripts with async do not block the HTML parsing and execute as soon as they are downloaded.

How async Works
The browser starts downloading the script in parallel with parsing the HTML document.
As soon as the script is downloaded, it immediately executes, even if HTML parsing is still in progress.
Scripts with async execute in no specific order — they run as soon as they are ready.
Syntax
html
Copy code
<script src="script.js" async></script>
Key Characteristics of async
No blocking: The script does not block the browser's HTML parsing process.
Execution timing: The script executes as soon as it's downloaded.
Execution order: Scripts with async execute in the order they finish downloading, not in the order they appear in the HTML.
Example
HTML:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Async Example</title>
  <script src="script1.js" async></script>
  <script src="script2.js" async></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
script1.js:
javascript
Copy code
console.log("Script 1 loaded");
script2.js:
javascript
Copy code
console.log("Script 2 loaded");
Possible Output in Console:
lua
Copy code
Script 2 loaded
Script 1 loaded
The order of execution depends on which script finishes downloading first.
The browser does not guarantee sequential execution of async scripts.
Difference Between async and defer
Attribute	Execution Timing	Execution Order	Blocks HTML Parsing?
async	Executes as soon as the script downloads	Unordered	Partially (when running)
defer	Executes after HTML parsing is complete	Ordered (top-to-bottom)	No
When to Use async?
When the script does not depend on other scripts or the HTML structure.
When you have independent scripts like:
Analytics scripts
Ads scripts
Third-party libraries that do not rely on DOM structure.
Practical Comparison
HTML with async:
html
Copy code
<script src="script1.js" async></script>
<script src="script2.js" async></script>
Scripts are downloaded in parallel and execute immediately once ready.
Order of execution is not guaranteed.
HTML with defer:
html
Copy code
<script src="script1.js" defer></script>
<script src="script2.js" defer></script>
Scripts are downloaded in parallel.
Execution happens after the HTML is fully parsed.
Scripts execute in the order they appear.
Summary
async:

*?Loads scripts asynchronously and executes them immediately when downloaded.
*?Does not wait for HTML parsing or other scripts.
*?Scripts may execute in any order.
*?Use async for scripts that do not depend on other scripts or the DOM structure.
