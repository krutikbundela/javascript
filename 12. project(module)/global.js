// In JavaScript, window.DEFAULT_VALUE and globalThis are concepts related to global objects and their usage in different environments (browsers and Node.js). Let’s break them down:

// 1. window.DEFAULT_VALUE
// window: The window object represents the global object in a browser environment. It serves as the container for all globally available variables, functions, and objects in a browser context (like alert, document, etc.).
// DEFAULT_VALUE: This seems to be a placeholder or an example of a global variable. You can define DEFAULT_VALUE as a property of the window object to store a global constant or configuration value in the browser.
// Example:

// // Defining a global constant in the window object
// window.DEFAULT_VALUE = 42;

// // Accessing the global constant
// console.log(window.DEFAULT_VALUE); // Output: 42
// In a browser environment, any global variable you define without using let, const, or var will be added to the window object. You can explicitly attach properties like window.DEFAULT_VALUE to the window object.

// 2. globalThis
// globalThis: Introduced in ES2020, globalThis is a global object that works consistently across different JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, workers, etc.). It provides a way to access the global object no matter where your code is running.
// In the browser, globalThis is equivalent to window.
// In Node.js, globalThis is equivalent to global.
// Before globalThis, accessing the global object was environment-specific:

// In browsers, you use window.
// In Node.js, you use global.
// With globalThis, you can reference the global object in a unified way across environments.

// Example:

// // Setting a global variable using globalThis
// globalThis.DEFAULT_VALUE = 100;

// // Accessing the global variable
// console.log(globalThis.DEFAULT_VALUE); // Output: 100
// globalThis provides a more consistent approach to accessing the global object, especially if you plan to write code that works in both browsers and Node.js.

// Key Differences:
// Environment Compatibility:

// window is specific to browsers and will not work in Node.js or other JavaScript environments (like workers).
// globalThis works across all JavaScript environments (browser, Node.js, workers, etc.), making it a more versatile solution.
// Usage:

// In browsers, window is commonly used, but with the introduction of globalThis, it’s becoming the preferred approach when aiming for cross-environment compatibility.
// globalThis is a modern way to refer to the global object, especially when writing universal code.
// Summary:
// window.DEFAULT_VALUE is a global variable defined within the window object, which is available in browser environments.
// globalThis is a more universal reference to the global object, providing compatibility across multiple environments like browsers, Node.js, and others.
